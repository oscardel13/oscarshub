                <p>
                Hey there! I'm Oscar, a first-generation Mexican-American software engineer. I fell in love with coding during my time at the University of Colorado Boulder, and I've been on a never-ending adventure of tech exploration ever since.
                </p>
                <p>
                I firmly believe that becoming well-versed in full-stack development, DevOps, and cloud technologies empowers me to create robust, scalable, and secure software solutions. I'm all about building my tech skills and well-being. Challenging projects, continuous learning, and self-care are my jam.
                </p>
                <p>
